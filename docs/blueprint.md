## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color (actions/brand): main: #00B37E, light: #33C69A, dark: #008763, contrastText: #FFFFFF (meets large-text thresholds on medium/dark greens; verify sizes for body text).
- Secondary color (comms/accent): main: #3498DB, light: #5FB2E8, dark: #1F78B4, contrastText: #FFFFFF (use for links, secondary CTAs).
- Emphasis accent (energy): main: #E36C2E, light: #F08E58, dark: #B84F1F, contrastText: #FFFFFF (sparingly for highlights/alerts).
- Neutral color (UI surfaces): bg: #F5F6FA, surface: #FFFFFF, border: #E6EDF3, text-primary: #2D3436, text-secondary: #5B636A (pairings verified to approach or exceed AA in most combinations).
- Neutral-variant color (dark mode surfaces): bg-dark: #0D1115, surface-dark: #161B22, on-surface: #E6EDF3, border-dark: #2A3037 (test all text at 4.5:1 minimum).
- Semantic states color (consistent across light/dark): success: #16A34A (light: #22C55E, dark: #15803D), warning: #F59E0B (light: #FBBF24, dark: #B45309), error: #EF4444 (light: #F87171, dark: #B91C1C), info: #3B82F6 (light: #60A5FA, dark: #1D4ED8) (pair each with on-color #FFFFFF for buttons/badges and ensure text meets AA).
- Use the 60–30–10 rule: 60% neutrals (background/surfaces), 30% primary family, 10% accents/semantic to maintain balance and avoid visual noise in dashboards.
- Map roles to components: Primary for CTAs/toggles/selection; Secondary for links/secondary buttons; Neutral for cards, tables, and nav; Semantic strictly for status, alerts, and validation.
- Always validate foreground/background pairs: body text 4.5:1+, large/bold 3:1+, and aim 7:1 for small/elevated UI like table cells and captions where readability is critical
